## Paper Information
“Automated Data Labeling for Object Detection via Iterative Instance Segmentation”
IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (IEEE ICMLA 2023), Conference Date: Dec 15-17, 2023.
•	As the First Author, developed and programmed an auto-labeling system using YOLOv8 with its instance segmentation technique, integrating with uncertainty-based correction algorithm and iterative training to reduce the need for manual labeling
•	Adopted the concepts of semi-supervised and active learning methods to refine the system
•	Processed and adapted the PlantVillage Dataset, featuring over 20,000 data instances for our experiments
•	Set new benchmarks in accuracy and efficiency, outperforming traditional models and the model conventionally trained on fully human-labeled dataset
